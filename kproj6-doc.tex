\chapter{Introduction}
\section{TDT 4290 - Customer driven project}
The task is set forth in the subject TDT 4290 - Customer driven project at the Norwegian university of science and technology. The goal of the course is 
\begin{quote}
(...)to give the students a practical experience of carrying out all the phases of a typical customer guided IS/IT-project.\cite{TDT4290 intro}
\end{quote}
The subject divides the students into random groups, and assigns each group an assignment. The assignments are real problems that businesses needs solved. 

Although the assignment is to follow the entire process of an IT-project, the focus is on the earlier phases of a project. Thus, an important part of the assignment is the work leading up to the implementation phase.

\section{Pre study}
To get an understanding of the customers needs, as well as studying different solutions, a pre study is conducted. From the course compendium:
\begin{quote}
The preliminary studies are vital for the group to obtain a good understanding of the total problem.
Here, you will have to describe the problem at hand. You should describe the current system and the
planned solutions (...).
\end{quote}

The report is produced to formalise the recommendation that is made to the customer. Although the report contains the entire background and recommendation, the customer has been kept up to date with the work, and been presented with our conclusions well before this study was finished. This has been necessary for our work to continue, and was agreed upon with the customer in advance.

\section{Work organisation}
In this first work period, we have worked in two phases. For the first phase, we worked with the goal of familiarising ourselves with the file format, and the technology. In this period the group was divided into two groups, one investigating the front end, and one the back end. For the second phase, the group adopted the scrum methodology, and used one sprint to finish the recommendation. 


\chapter{Assignment and use cases}
This chapter will give a brief description of the assignment given to the group, the problem domain, as well as some example use cases. 
\section{Domain}
The groups assignment is connected to SINTEFs work on oceanographic simulations. By analysing large amounts of observational data, and running this trough complex simulations, the goal is to predict future conditions. 

More specifically, the currents, temperature, salinity and other factors are recorded, simulated and predicted. These predictions are used mainly by stakeholders in the fish farming industry for decision support. Usually this is in conjunction with lice removal, which requires precise positioning of large supply vessels. 

\section{Assignment}
The assignment set forth by SINTEF is to improve the current solution to be able to serve the user with dynamically created views of the data. 
\section{Use cases}

\chapter{Current situation}
In this chapter we will explore the solution SINTEF is currently using, and the challenges and limitations it poses. After looking into this, we will describe the evaluation criteria that will be used to assess the alternative solutions the group has found. 
\section{Current system}
The current system deployed at SINTEF 
\section{Challenges}
\section{Evaluation criteria}

\chapter{Possible solutions}
The group has used the first part of the project investigating what solutions would best suit SINTEFs needs. In the chapter we present the different solutions we have found, along with an assessment on how each solution is rated in accordance to the evaluation criteria. 

\section{Back-end}

\section{Front-end}

\chapter{Recommendation}
Based on the study of possible solutions in the previous chapter, the group will give a recommendation.
