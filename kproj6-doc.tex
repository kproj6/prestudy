\chapter{Introduction}
\section{TDT 4290 - Customer driven project}
The task is set forth in the subject TDT 4290 - Customer driven project at the Norwegian university of science and technology. The goal of the course is 
\begin{quote}
(...)to give the students a practical experience of carrying out all the phases of a typical customer guided IS/IT-project.\cite{TDT4290 intro}
\end{quote}
The subject divides the students into random groups, and assigns each group an assignment. The assignments are real problems that businesses needs solved. 

Although the assignment is to follow the entire process of an IT-project, the focus is on the earlier phases of a project. Thus, an important part of the assignment is the work leading up to the implementation phase.

\section{Pre study}
To get an understanding of the customers needs, as well as studying different solutions, a pre study is conducted. From the course compendium:
\begin{quote}
The preliminary studies are vital for the group to obtain a good understanding of the total problem.
Here, you will have to describe the problem at hand. You should describe the current system and the
planned solutions (...)
\end{quote}

\section{Work organization}

\chapter{Assignment and use cases}
This chapter will give a brief description of the assignment given to the group, the problem domain, as well as some example use cases. 
\section{Domain}
\section{Assignment}
\section{Use cases}

\chapter{Current situation}
In this chapter we will explore the solution SINTEF is currently using, and the challenges and limitations it poses. After looking into this, we will describe the evaluation criteria that will be used to assess the alternative solutions the group has found. 
\section{Current system}
\section{Challenges}
\section{Evaluation criteria}

\chapter{Possible solutions}
The group has used the first part of the project investigating what solutions would best suit SINTEFs needs. In the chapter we present the different solutions we have found, along with an assessment on how each solution is rated in accordance to the evaluation criteria. 
\section{Commercial solutions}
\section{Open source solutions}
\section{Custom solutions}

\chapter{Recommendation}
Based on the study of possible solutions in the previous chapter, the group will give a recommendation.
