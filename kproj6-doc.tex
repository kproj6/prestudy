\chapter{Introduction}
\section{TDT 4290 - Customer driven project}
The task is set forth in the subject TDT 4290 - Customer driven project at the Norwegian university of science and technology. The goal of the course is 
\begin{quote}
(...)to give the students a practical experience of carrying out all the phases of a typical customer guided IS/IT-project.\cite{TDT4290 intro}
\end{quote}
The subject divides the students into random groups, and assigns each group an assignment. The assignments are real problems that businesses needs solved. 

Although the assignment is to follow the entire process of an IT-project, the focus is on the earlier phases of a project. Thus, an important part of the assignment is the work leading up to the implementation phase.

\section{Pre study}
To get an understanding of the customers needs, as well as studying different solutions, a pre study is conducted. From the course compendium:
\begin{quote}
The preliminary studies are vital for the group to obtain a good understanding of the total problem.
Here, you will have to describe the problem at hand. You should describe the current system and the
planned solutions (...).
\end{quote}

The report is produced to formalise the recommendation that is made to the customer. Although the report contains the entire background and recommendation, the customer has been kept up to date with the work, and been presented with our conclusions well before this study was finished. This has been necessary for our work to continue, and was agreed upon with the customer in advance.

\section{Work organisation}
In this first work period, we have worked in two phases. For the first phase, we worked with the goal of familiarising ourselves with the file format, and the technology. In this period the group was divided into two groups, one investigating the front end, and one the back end. For the second phase, the group adopted the scrum methodology, and used one sprint to finish the recommendation. 


\chapter{Assignment and use cases}
This chapter will give a brief description of the assignment given to the group, the problem domain, as well as some example use cases. 
\section{Domain}
The groups assignment is connected to SINTEFs work on oceanographic simulations. By analysing large amounts of observational data, and running this trough complex simulations, the goal is to predict future conditions. 

More specifically, the currents, temperature, salinity and other factors are recorded, simulated and predicted. These predictions are used mainly by stakeholders in the fish farming industry for decision support. Usually this is in conjunction with lice removal, which requires precise positioning of large supply vessels. 

\section{Assignment}
The assignment set forth by SINTEF is to improve the current solution to be able to serve the user with dynamically created views of the data. 
\section{Use cases}

\chapter{Current situation}
In this chapter we will explore the solution SINTEF is currently using, and the challenges and limitations it poses. After looking into this, we will describe the evaluation criteria that will be used to assess the alternative solutions the group has found. 
\section{Current system}
The current system deployed at SINTEF 
\section{Challenges}
\section{Evaluation criteria}

\chapter{Possible solutions}
The group has used the first part of the project investigating what solutions would best suit SINTEFs needs. In the chapter we present the different solutions we have found, along with an assessment on how each solution is rated in accordance to the evaluation criteria. 

\section{Back-end}
\subsection{GeoServer}

Does not support NetCDF natively. There exsists a community plugin that enables you to read from NetCDF files, but the support seems very shifty. Does not seem to be support for more than a single file, and metadata looks like a pain to extract. Further investigation was aborted.

\section{Front-end}

  \subsection{Map services}

  A central part of the product requirement is an interactive map to display simulated data in a dynamic manner. There exists several solutions to create such a map. In this section we will discuss and compare the most relevant of these in the context of our assignment and the product requirements.

  \paragraph{Introduction} \indent
  LeafletJS ("Leaflet" for the rest of the section) is an open source javascript library for creating mobile-friendly interactive maps. it's licenced under the \href{'https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE'}{2-clause BSD License}, which makes it free to use in comercial applications as long as a credit is added somewhere in the user interface.
  Even though Leaflet is free to use it is dependant on a third party to provide the map tiles. These may not be free to use.

  \paragraph{Features}
  Leaflet has the features you'd expect from a modern interactive map. This includes paning with inertia, zooming and the ability to add markers. It also supports double-tap and pinch to zoom for IOS and Androidon mobile phones. Furthermore all the five biggest web browsers are supported, including graceful fallback for old versions.
  The most powerful feature of Leaflet is the ability to add layers. 
  \newline The different supported layers are:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Tile layers
    \item Marker layers
    \item Pop-ups
    \item Vector layers
    \item GeoJSON layers
    \item image overlays
    \item WMS layers
    \item Layer groups
  \end{itemize}

  For our purposes the ability to get map tiles from different sources may be very interesting. This gives us the ability to for example show both nautical maps and regular land maps at the convenience of the user. At zoom levels covering large geographical areas it will probably be most ideal to show the relevant simulated data as overlayed PNGs. This is easily achieved with image overlays in Leaflet. If we want to show very detailed data when zoomed further in, we might be able to use vector layers to visualize the data. It is also possible to use a GeoJSON layer to convert data formatted as GeoJSON to vectors.
  It is also possible to use Web Map Service (WMS) to overlay, for example, metrological data on a map. Eventhough this is a format that is used by large organizations like the National Oceanic and Atsmopheric Administration (\url{noaa.gov}) we have been advised against using this format due to it's negative effect on the speed and responsiveness experieced by the end-user. \footnote{Cite the guy Marco talked with at Yahoo}
  Furthermore Leaflet can be extended with plugins. These can relatively easily be written in Javascript or an excisting plugin can be downloaded and used. A relevant plugin to our needs could for exmaple be heatmap.js (http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/).

  \paragraph{Summary}
  Leaflet is very suitable for our needs in respect to creating an interactive map overlayed with visualizations of relevant data created by the Sintef ocean forecast simulations. It's lightweight(33 kilobytes), made to be compatible with mobile phones and very flexible in possibilities to display data on maps. It's also well documented.
